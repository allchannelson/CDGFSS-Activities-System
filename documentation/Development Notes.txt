Authenticate
- role (Staff, Vice Principal, Principal)
  - actions allowed (review, first approval, second approval, enter new activity)

Allow actions
- Separate pages?  IFrames?  Hmm, not really sure.  Probably needs to be plugin like and modular.
** Short term.  Staff, VP, and P pages.  Probably just set them up as custom pages for now.  No management options available.

First step.  Create an activity, insert students involved.
- Activity + Student table.  Activity ID + Student ID
- Activity ID: activity details
- Student ID: student details

Student + Activity.  Historical records?
? What happens when students change grades and class?  Are old records accurate?
  - One solution make class and class number relational... but this will complicate the activity record a LOT more, since it will now tie in 3 tables of data instead of two.
  
DB
? What to do with concurrency?  Someone changes something while someone uses the data that is being changed?
 - Make it so things being changed are not used in keys.
   - Student Primary Key is StudentNo + Year
   
? How long are activities recorded for reference?
? When are student numbers recycled?  - solved.  Use Student No + Year as concatenated primary key, ensuring uniqueness even if they are reused.
